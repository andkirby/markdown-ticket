# MCP mdt-all Tools Testing Prompt

You are testing the MCP mdt-all tools functionality. Your task is to perform a complete workflow with a ticket in the DEB project, ensuring you use various tools naturally throughout the process.

## Your Mission

You are a project manager working on the DEB project. You need to:

1. **Explore the project structure** - Get familiar with available projects and DEB project details
2. **Review existing tickets** - Check what tickets already exist in the DEB project
3. **Create a new ticket** - Add a documentation ticket for improving API documentation
4. **Work with the ticket content** - Add detailed implementation specifications
5. **Update ticket attributes** - Modify priority, assignee, and other metadata
6. **Update ticket status** - Progress through the workflow stages
7. **Manage ticket sections** - Work with specific sections of the ticket
8. **Get improvement suggestions** - Analyze the ticket for completeness and apply recommendation.
9. **Clean up** - Delete the ticket since it's just for testing

## Ticket Details to Create

Create a documentation ticket with these specifications:
- Title: "Improve API Documentation for Endpoints"
- Type: Documentation
- Priority: Medium
- Include sections for description, rationale, solution analysis, implementation spec, and acceptance criteria
- Make it comprehensive enough to demonstrate section management capabilities

## Natural Workflow Guidance

- Start by exploring what projects are available
- Get detailed information about the DEB project
- Review existing tickets to understand the current state
- Create your new ticket with thoughtful content
- Use section management to refine specific parts
- Update attributes and status as if you're actually working on it
- Get suggestions for improvement before finalizing
- Clean up by deleting the test ticket

## Key Points

- Work naturally as if you're actually managing a project ticket
- Don't explicitly mention which tools you're using
- Use the tools that make sense for each task
- Ensure you delete the ticket at the end to clean up
- The goal is to test the full MCP toolset through realistic usage

Remember: This is a test scenario, so the ticket should be deleted once you've completed the workflow testing.

> what's the best way to "watch" file changes without overhead for this app?

⏺ Looking at your current architecture, I can see you're using polling with fileWatcher.ts that checks every 1
  second. Here are better approaches with less overhead:

⏺ For your app, here are better approaches than polling every 1 second:

  1. WebSockets (Best for real-time)

  Add WebSocket support to your Express server for instant updates:

  // server/server.js
  const WebSocket = require('ws');
  const chokidar = require('chokidar');

  const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
  const watcher = chokidar.watch('./tasks/*.md');

  watcher.on('change', (path) => {
    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'file-changed', path }));
      }
    });
  });

  2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

  Simpler than WebSockets, one-way from server to client:

  // Add to your Express server
  app.get('/api/events', (req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, {
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
      'Connection': 'keep-alive'
    });

    const watcher = chokidar.watch('./tasks/*.md');
    watcher.on('change', () => {
      res.write('data: {"type":"file-changed"}\n\n');
    });
  });

  3. Smart Polling (Easiest upgrade)

  Reduce overhead by:
  - Using HTTP If-Modified-Since headers
  - Exponential backoff when no changes
  - Only polling when tab is active

  // Increase interval when idle, check visibility
  setPollingInterval(document.hidden ? 10000 : 2000);

  document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    setPollingInterval(document.hidden ? 10000 : 1000);
  });

  4. Chokidar on Backend

  Your server should use chokidar to watch files instead of letting the frontend poll:

  npm install chokidar --save

  Recommendation: Start with Server-Sent Events - it's the easiest upgrade from your current setup with minimal
  overhead and real-time updates.

> @agent-software-architect-advisor I'm thinking about this approach [backend] do watch files change (maybe for 
  "update date", I guess chokidar do this job well) and then send updates to frontend?

  What do you think?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about using a backend approach where the backend watches for file changes (probably using 
  chokidar) and then sends updates to the frontend. They mentioned "update date" which suggests they want to track when
   files are modified. They want the software architect advisor agent to evaluate this approach.

  I need to invoke the software-architect-advisor agent and provide context about their current system and the proposed
   approach.

⏺ software-architect-advisor(Evaluate file watching architecture)
  ⎿  Done (3 tool uses · 32.2k tokens · 48.8s)                                                                    

✻ Thinking…

  The software-architect-advisor agent has provided a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture. The agent 
  strongly endorses the approach of using backend file watching (chokidar) with push updates to the frontend. The key 
  points are:

  1. It's an excellent architectural decision
  2. Server-Sent Events (SSE) is recommended over WebSockets for this use case
  3. The approach provides immediate updates, better resource efficiency, and scalability
  4. There are important considerations around connection management, event ordering, and conflict resolution
  5. Implementation should be phased with polling fallback

  The analysis is thorough and provides practical implementation recommendations. I should summarize the key points 
  concisely for the user.

⏺ The software architect strongly endorses your approach! Here are the key points:

  ✅ Excellent Architectural Decision

  Why it's better:
  - Immediate updates (no 1-second delay)
  - Resource efficient (eliminates constant polling)
  - Better scalability (supports more users with less overhead)
  - Enhanced UX for collaborative editing

  🎯 Recommended Implementation

  Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) instead of WebSockets:
  - Perfect for unidirectional file-change notifications
  - Simpler than WebSockets
  - Built-in browser reconnection
  - Works through firewalls/proxies

  ⚠️ Key Considerations

  1. Event debouncing - Prevent storms from rapid file changes
  2. Connection management - Handle SSE drops gracefully
  3. Conflict resolution - Multiple users editing simultaneously
  4. Fallback strategy - Keep polling as backup when SSE fails

  🚀 Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Add chokidar + SSE endpoint
  Phase 2: Replace frontend polling with SSE
  Phase 3: Keep your existing localStorage fallback system

  The architecture maintains your current reliability while adding real-time capabilities. Your existing
  offline-capable design makes this transition safer since you already have robust fallback mechanisms.

  Want to start implementing this? I'd recommend beginning with the backend chokidar integration first.

       11 -  ## Overview
       11 +  ## 1. Description
       12    
       13 -  Replace the current polling-based file watching system with a push-based architecture using 
          - Server-Sent Events (SSE) and chokidar file system monitoring. This will improve performance, reduce 
          - resource usage, and provide real-time updates for the Kanban ticket board.
       13 +  ### Problem Statement
       14 +  The current polling-based file watching system creates unnecessary overhead and provides suboptimal
          +  user experience with 1-second delays for file change detection.
       15    
       16 -  ## Current State Analysis
       17 -  
       18 -  ### Existing Architecture
       16 +  ### Current State
       17    - **Frontend**: React app polling backend every 1 second via `fileWatcher.ts`
       18    - **Backend**: Express.js REST API serving markdown files from `server/sample-tasks/`
       19    - **Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
       20    - **Fallback**: localStorage caching for offline scenarios
       21    
       22 -  ### Performance Issues
       23 -  - Constant HTTP requests every 1 second regardless of changes
       24 -  - 1-second delay for detecting file modifications
       25 -  - Unnecessary network/CPU usage when no changes occur
       26 -  - Poor scalability with multiple concurrent users
       22 +  ### Desired State
       23 +  Real-time file change notifications using Server-Sent Events (SSE) with chokidar file system 
          + monitoring, providing immediate updates and reducing resource usage.
       24    
       25 +  ### Rationale
       26 +  - Eliminate constant HTTP polling overhead (1 request/second regardless of changes)
       27 +  - Provide immediate user feedback (< 100ms vs 1000ms delay)
       28 +  - Improve scalability for multiple concurrent users
       29 +  - Reduce client-side CPU and battery usage
       30 +  - Maintain existing offline functionality and reliability
       31 +  
       32 +  ### Impact Areas
       33 +  - Backend: New SSE endpoint and file watching service
       34 +  - Frontend: New real-time connection management
       35 +  - Existing API: Remains unchanged for compatibility
       36 +  - Performance: Significant reduction in network requests and latency

> Ok, I think we will follow the same approach - use the same path "docs/CRs".
  But instead of "CR", use the project code: MDT, so that tickets will be recognizable.

  I need to use @docs/CRs_manual.md from project to project.
  I need to unify it. First challenge: Project/tickets key, like in our case it's the change from CR to MDT.

  Somehow, LLM when generate a ticket shall understand this.

  @agent-solutions-architect what do you think if @docs/CRs_manual.md become a global knowledge, but "tasks" folder 
  will use some ".config.md" file with reference to @docs/CRs_manual.md (global one in future), and have some own 
  settings, like the project key code.

  Any ideas else?
  ⎿  Read docs/CRs_manual.md (224 lines)

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to invoke the solutions-architect agent to discuss a broader architectural problem around 
  documentation and change request (CR) management across multiple projects. They want to:

  1. Use the same CRs_manual.md approach across projects
  2. But customize the project code (e.g., "CR" becomes "MDT" for this markdown ticket project)
  3. Make the CRs_manual.md a global/shared knowledge base
  4. Have project-specific configuration files that reference the global manual but customize project-specific settings
   like the project key code
  5. Get architectural advice on how to structure this system

  This is definitely a solutions architect question since it involves:
  - System architecture for documentation management
  - Cross-project standardization
  - Configuration management
  - Template/pattern reuse
  - Strategic technology decisions about documentation systems

  Let me invoke the solutions-architect agent with the proper context.

  4. Maintenance Strategy: Version management and sync capabilities
  5. Alternative Analysis: Considered and rejected other approaches with clear reasoning

  The key insights are:
  - Use TOML configuration files for project-specific settings
  - Template-based documentation generation with variable substitution
  - Auto-discovery patterns for tooling integration
  - Clear separation between global standards and project customization
  - Practical implementation phases

  This gives the user a solid foundation to build a scalable cross-project documentation system.

⏺ The solutions architect recommends a hierarchical configuration architecture with template-based documentation.
  Here are the key architectural insights:

  🏗️ Recommended Architecture

  Configuration Structure

  Global Layer: ~/.config/dev-docs/
  ├── templates/CRs_manual.md    # Global template  
  └── schemas/project-config.schema.json

  Project Layer: <project>/docs/
  ├── .cr-config.toml           # Project settings
  └── CRs_manual.md            # Generated from global template

  Project Configuration (.cr-config.toml)

  [project]
  code = "MDT"                  # Your project code
  name = "Markdown Ticket Board"

  [cr]
  prefix = "MDT-A"             # Results in MDT-A001, MDT-A002, etc.
  template = "default"

  [paths]
  crDirectory = "CRs"

  🔧 Template System

  Global template uses variables:
  ## Naming Convention
  Change Requests follow: `{{project.crPrefix}}###`

  Examples: {{project.crPrefix}}001, {{project.crPrefix}}002

  Store CRs in: `{{paths.crDirectory}}/`

  🤖 Tool Integration

  Auto-discovery for Claude Code:
  - Look for .cr-config.toml in project
  - Extract project code automatically
  - Generate CRs with correct naming (MDT-A001, etc.)
  - Validate format against project standards

  📊 Global vs Project-Specific

  | Component        | Global   | Project   | Why                    |
  |------------------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
  | Process docs     | ✓        | Generated | Consistency            |
  | Project code     |          | ✓         | Unique identifiers     |
  | File paths       | Template | ✓         | Flexible structure     |
  | Validation rules | ✓        | Override  | Standards + exceptions |

  🚀 Implementation Phases

  1. Foundation: Global template + project config schema
  2. Automation: CLI tools + auto-numbering
  3. Integration: IDE plugins + git hooks

  This approach gives you standardized processes with project flexibility while enabling tool automation to
  automatically understand your MDT project codes!

  Want to start implementing the .cr-config.toml for this project?

> Em... CR - initially related to Change Requests, but I see it could be a project code.
  CR-A - "A" stands for phase.
  File paths and Validation rules - what are these about?

⏺ You're absolutely right to ask for clarification! Let me break down these concepts:

  CR Structure Explained

  CR Code Breakdown

  - CR = Project code (Change Request in original, but becomes MDT for your project)
  - A = Phase/Epic identifier (A = Foundation, B = Enhancement, C = Advanced, etc.)
  - ### = Sequential number within that phase

  So for your project:
  - MDT-A001 = Markdown Ticket, Phase A (Foundation), Item 001
  - MDT-A002 = Markdown Ticket, Phase A (Foundation), Item 002
  - MDT-B001 = Markdown Ticket, Phase B (Enhancement), Item 001

  File Paths Configuration

  This refers to where CRs are stored in each project:

  Global Template Says:
  Store CRs in: {{paths.crDirectory}}/

  Project Config Specifies:
  [paths]
  crDirectory = "docs/CRs"        # Some projects might use "documentation/changes"
                                  # Or "project-docs/requirements" 
                                  # Template adapts to each project's structure

  Validation Rules

  Rules that check if CRs follow proper format:

  Global Rules (same for all projects):
  - Must have required header fields (Title, Status, Date, etc.)
  - Must follow 6-section structure (Description, Solution Analysis, etc.)
  - Status must be valid (Proposed, Approved, In Progress, etc.)

  Project-Specific Overrides:
  [validation]
  requirePhasePrefix = true       # MDT must start with MDT-A, MDT-B, etc.
  allowedPhases = ["A", "B", "C"] # This project only has 3 phases
  customFields = ["assignee"]     # This project requires assignee field

  Your Current Document

  Your push-based-file-watching-requirements.md would become:
  - Filename: MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md
  - CR Code: MDT-A001
  - Location: docs/CRs/MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md

  Does this clarify the structure? The key insight is that CR was just the original project's code, but each
  project gets its own (like MDT for yours).

> I'm just thinking what if someone wouldn't want to use "CR" terminology?.. In the same time, "task" would mean it's
   a task, something simple and clear, CR is a complext term and perfectly fits in the same time...

⏺ You're absolutely right! The terminology choice is crucial for adoption and clarity.

  Terminology Dilemma

  "CR" (Change Request) pros:
  - ✅ Professional, enterprise-standard terminology
  - ✅ Clearly indicates formal documentation process
  - ✅ Distinguishes from simple "tasks" - these are architectural decisions
  - ✅ Matches industry ADR (Architectural Decision Record) practices

  "CR" cons:
  - ❌ Complex/intimidating for some teams
  - ❌ Not immediately intuitive
  - ❌ Might feel overly formal for smaller projects

  Alternative Approaches

  Option 1: Flexible Terminology

  Let projects choose their own term via config:

  [terminology]
  documentType = "Task"        # or "CR", "RFC", "ADR", "Spec"
  prefix = "MDT-T"            # becomes MDT-T001 instead of MDT-A001
  filePrefix = "Task"         # Task-001-push-based-watching.md

  Option 2: Context-Aware Naming

  [project]
  documentStyle = "engineering"  # Uses "CR", "ADR" terminology
  # OR
  documentStyle = "agile"        # Uses "Task", "Story" terminology  
  # OR  
  documentStyle = "startup"      # Uses "RFC", "Proposal" terminology

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach

  Keep the process (6-section structure, lifecycle management) but let teams call it whatever feels natural:
  - Engineering teams: "Change Requests"
  - Agile teams: "Epic Tasks"
  - Startups: "Technical RFCs"
  - Open source: "Proposals"

  My Recommendation

  Keep "CR" as the default because:
  1. It accurately describes what these are - they're not simple tasks, they're formal change specifications
  2. Industry standard - aligns with established practices
  3. But make terminology configurable for teams that prefer alternatives

  What feels right for your context? The substance (structured documentation, ADR lifecycle) is more important than
   the label.

> Yes, it has to be related to ADR lifecycle. What's you advise?

⏺ My Strong Recommendation: Keep "CR" Terminology

  Since you want ADR lifecycle alignment, "CR" (Change Request) is the perfect choice. Here's why:

  ADR Lifecycle Alignment

  Traditional ADR Pattern:
  Proposed → Accepted → Implemented → Superseded/Deprecated

  CR Pattern (matches ADR perfectly):
  Proposed → Approved → In Progress → Implemented → [Archive as permanent ADR]

  The CR terminology naturally bridges the gap between:
  - Active development (specification document)
  - Historical record (architectural decision record)

  Why CR > Alternatives for ADR Context

  | Term                | ADR Alignment    | Professional         | Clear Intent                              |
  |---------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
  | CR (Change Request) | ✅ Perfect        | ✅ Enterprise         | ✅ Formal process                          |
  | Task                | ❌ Too simple     | ❌ Casual             | ❌ Unclear scope                           |
  | RFC                 | ✅ Good           | ✅ Technical          | ⚠️ "Request for Comment" implies optional |
  | Proposal            | ✅ Good           | ✅ Professional       | ⚠️ Sounds tentative                       |
  | Epic                | ❌ Agile-specific | ⚠️ Context-dependent | ❌ Not architectural                       |

  The ADR Connection

  CRs become permanent ADRs - this is the key insight:

  # During Development
  CR-MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md
  Status: In Progress

  # After Implementation
  CR-MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md
  Status: Implemented ← Now it's a permanent ADR!

  Configuration Flexibility

  Still allow customization for teams that need it:

  [terminology]
  documentType = "CR"          # Default: Change Request
  acronymExpansion = "Change Request"
  alternateTerms = ["ADR", "Technical Decision", "Architecture Change"]

  My Advice: Embrace "CR"

  1. It's the right tool - CRs are exactly what ADRs should be in active development
  2. Professional standard - aligns with enterprise practices
  3. Clear intent - signals formal architectural documentation
  4. Future-proof - when CRs become historical ADRs, the terminology still makes sense

  The slight learning curve is worth it for the precision and professional alignment you get. Teams quickly adapt
  to meaningful terminology when they see the value.

  Stick with CR! 🎯

> Ok, how it would impact configuration?

⏺ Configuration Impact for CR + ADR Approach

  Here's how keeping "CR" terminology shapes the configuration:

  Project Configuration (.cr-config.toml)

  [project]
  name = "Markdown Ticket Board"
  code = "MDT"                    # Project identifier
  description = "Kanban-style ticket board with markdown storage"

  [cr]
  # CR-specific settings
  prefix = "CR-MDT-A"            # Results in: CR-MDT-A001, CR-MDT-A002
  startNumber = 1                # First CR number
  phases = ["A", "B", "C"]       # A=Foundation, B=Enhancement, C=Advanced

  [lifecycle]
  # ADR lifecycle alignment
  activeStatuses = ["Proposed", "Approved", "In Progress"]
  archivalStatuses = ["Implemented", "Rejected", "Superseded"]
  implementedBecomesADR = true   # Key setting!

  [paths]
  crDirectory = "CRs"            # docs/CRs/
  templateSource = "~/.config/dev-docs/templates/CRs_manual.md"
  counterFile = ".cr-counter"    # Track next available number

  [validation]
  requireCRPrefix = true         # Must start with CR-MDT-A
  enforcePhases = true          # Phase must be in allowed list
  mandatoryFields = [           # Required header fields
    "CR Code",
    "Title/Summary",
    "Status",
    "Date Created",
    "Type",
    "Priority",
    "Phase/Epic"
  ]

  [automation]
  autoNumbering = true          # Auto-increment CR numbers
  statusValidation = true       # Validate status transitions
  generateProjectDocs = true   # Auto-update local CRs_manual.md

  File Structure Impact

  docs/
  ├── .cr-config.toml          # Project configuration
  ├── CRs_manual.md           # Generated from global template
  ├── .cr-counter             # Next available: CR-MDT-A002
  └── CRs/
      └── CR-MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md

  Template Variables

  # Global template: ~/.config/dev-docs/templates/CRs_manual.md

  ## CR Naming Convention
  Change Requests follow: `{{cr.prefix}}###`

  Examples:
  - {{cr.prefix}}001 - First change request  
  - {{cr.prefix}}002 - Second change request

  ## Lifecycle → ADR Conversion
  When status becomes "Implemented", the CR serves as permanent ADR.

  Store CRs in: `{{paths.crDirectory}}/`
  Next available: {{cr.prefix}}{{nextNumber}}

  Tool Integration Impact

  // Claude Code discovers configuration
  interface CRConfig {
    project: {
      code: string;        // "MDT"
      name: string;
    };
    cr: {
      prefix: string;      // "CR-MDT-A" 
      phases: string[];    // ["A", "B", "C"]
    };
    lifecycle: {
      implementedBecomesADR: boolean; // true
    };
  }

  // Auto-generate with correct naming
  function createCR(title: string): string {
    const config = loadCRConfig();
    const number = getNextCRNumber();
    return `${config.cr.prefix}${number.toString().padStart(3, '0')}`;
    // Results in: CR-MDT-A001
  }

  Key Configuration Benefits

  1. ADR Alignment: implementedBecomesADR = true makes the lifecycle explicit
  2. Project Identity: CR-MDT-A clearly identifies this project's architectural decisions
  3. Phase Management: Tracks which development phase each CR belongs to
  4. Tool Automation: Configuration enables automatic CR numbering and validation

  Migration Impact

  Your current file would become:
  - From: push-based-file-watching-requirements.md
  - To: CR-MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md
  - Header: CR Code: CR-MDT-A001

  This configuration design embraces the CR → ADR lifecycle while keeping everything project-specific and
  tool-automatable!

> MDT-A### - this format is more than enough. We don't need CR in the filename.
  Ok, let's stick to CR approach, but let's consider tickets itself as "issue" in the code. Jira has "issues" so do 
  we!

⏺ Perfect! "Issues" is brilliant terminology - familiar, clear, and Jira-aligned! 🎯

  Updated Configuration: CR Process + Issue Terminology

  [project]
  name = "Markdown Ticket Board"
  code = "MDT"
  description = "Kanban-style ticket board with markdown storage"

  [issues]  # Using "issues" instead of "cr"
  prefix = "MDT-A"              # Clean format: MDT-A001, MDT-A002
  startNumber = 1
  phases = ["A", "B", "C"]      # A=Foundation, B=Enhancement, C=Advanced

  [lifecycle]
  # CR process but called "issues"
  activeStatuses = ["Proposed", "Approved", "In Progress"]
  archivalStatuses = ["Implemented", "Rejected", "Superseded"]
  implementedBecomesADR = true

  [paths]
  issueDirectory = "CRs"        # Still use /CRs for formal architectural issues
  templateSource = "~/.config/dev-docs/templates/CRs_manual.md"
  counterFile = ".issue-counter"

  [terminology]
  documentType = "Issue"        # What we call them in conversation
  formalType = "Change Request" # What they actually are (ADR process)

  File Structure

  docs/
  ├── .cr-config.toml          # Configuration
  ├── CRs_manual.md           # "Managing Issues" (generated)
  ├── .issue-counter          # Next: MDT-A002
  └── CRs/                    # Formal architectural issues
      └── MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md

  Template Variables

  ## Issue Naming Convention
  {{terminology.documentType}}s follow: `{{issues.prefix}}###`

  Examples:
  - {{issues.prefix}}001 - Push-based file watching
  - {{issues.prefix}}002 - User authentication system

  These {{terminology.documentType}}s are formal {{terminology.formalType}}s that become permanent ADRs.

  Tool Integration

  // Easy to understand in code
  interface ProjectConfig {
    issues: {
      prefix: string;      // "MDT-A"
      nextNumber: number;  // 2
    };
    terminology: {
      documentType: string;     // "Issue" 
      formalType: string;       // "Change Request"
    };
  }

  // Natural function names
  function createIssue(title: string): string {
    return `${config.issues.prefix}${getNextIssueNumber()}`;
  }

  function getIssueById(id: string): Issue {
    // Load MDT-A001, MDT-A002, etc.
  }

  Benefits of This Approach

  ✅ Familiar: "Issues" matches Jira/GitHub terminology✅ Clean IDs: MDT-A001 (no redundant "CR" prefix)✅ Proper 
  Process: Still follows formal CR → ADR lifecycle✅ Tool Friendly: Easy to code against, natural naming✅
  Professional: Maintains architectural rigor behind friendly terminology

  Your Current File Becomes

  - ID: MDT-A001
  - File: MDT-A001-push-based-file-watching.md
  - Header: Issue Code: MDT-A001 (but it's really a CR!)
  - Talk: "Let's review issue MDT-A001"
  - Reality: Full CR process with ADR lifecycle

  This gives you the best of both worlds - approachable "issues" terminology with robust architectural decision
  management! 🚀

> Issue Code: MDT-A001 -> "Code:"

⏺ Perfect! Much cleaner and more concise:

  Header Format

  - **Code**: MDT-A001
  - **Title/Summary**: Push-Based File Watching Architecture
  - **Status**: Proposed
  - **Date Created**: 2025-08-31
  - **Type**: Architecture
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Phase/Epic**: Phase A (Foundation)

  Updated Configuration

  [issues]
  prefix = "MDT-A"
  codeField = "Code"              # Header field name

  [validation]
  mandatoryFields = [
    "Code",                      # Instead of "Issue Code" or "CR Code"
    "Title/Summary",
    "Status",
    "Date Created",
    "Type",
    "Priority",
    "Phase/Epic"
  ]

  Template Variables

  ## Issue Format
  Every issue must include a header with:
  - **{{validation.codeField}}**: {{issues.prefix}}### (unique identifier)
  - **Title/Summary**: Brief descriptive title
  ...

  Clean, simple, and no redundant terminology! The Code field is self-explanatory and works perfectly for MDT-A001,
   MDT-A002, etc.

  Your current file just needs the header updated:
  - - **CR Code**: CR-A001
  + - **Code**: MDT-A001

  Much better! 🎯

> prefix = "MDT-A" I'm not sure if it's valid...
  theoritically a project could move to another phase and in this case it will be MDT-B. How other issues will be 
  processed? I don't know what's the best way here.

⏺ Excellent point! You've identified a real design challenge. Let me break down the options:

  The Phase Transition Problem

  When you move from Phase A → Phase B:
  - Do new issues become MDT-B001, MDT-B002...?
  - Or continue with MDT-A005, MDT-A006...?
  - What about cross-phase dependencies?

  Architectural Options

  Option 1: Phase-Specific Numbering

  [issues]
  projectCode = "MDT"
  currentPhase = "A"           # Changes to "B" later
  # Results in: MDT-A001, MDT-A002... then MDT-B001, MDT-B002...

  Pros: Clear phase separation, logical groupingCons: Complex numbering, phase transition management,
  cross-references get messy

  Option 2: Global Sequential Numbering

  [issues]
  prefix = "MDT"              # Just project code
  phases = ["A", "B", "C"]    # Track in metadata, not ID
  # Results in: MDT-001, MDT-002, MDT-003... (phase in header)

  Pros: Simple, continuous, no transition issuesCons: Loses phase visibility in ID

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach

  [issues]
  projectCode = "MDT"
  defaultPhase = "A"          # Most issues are Phase A
  allowPhaseOverride = true   # Can manually specify MDT-B001 when needed
  # Results in: MDT-A001, MDT-A002, MDT-B001 (when explicitly B)

  My Recommendation: Option 2 (Global Sequential)

  [issues]
  projectCode = "MDT"         # Clean: MDT-001, MDT-002, MDT-003
  startNumber = 1

  Why?
  - Simpler: No phase transition complexity
  - Continuous: Natural progression without gaps
  - Phase info preserved: In header Phase/Epic: Phase A (Foundation)
  - Future-proof: Works regardless of project evolution

  File structure:
  CRs/
  ├── MDT-001-push-based-file-watching.md    # Phase A
  ├── MDT-002-user-authentication.md         # Phase A
  ├── MDT-003-advanced-search.md             # Phase B (later)

  Search by phase still works:
  grep "Phase/Epic: Phase B" docs/CRs/*.md

  What do you think? Keep it simple with MDT-### and track phase in metadata?

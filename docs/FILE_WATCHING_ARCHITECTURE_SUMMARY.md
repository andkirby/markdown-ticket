# File Watching Architecture - Comprehensive Summary

## Executive Overview

This document summarizes the complete file watching architecture solution developed for the Markdown Ticket Board application. The solution replaces an inefficient polling-based system with a modern, real-time architecture using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and chokidar file system monitoring.

---

## 1. Core Problem and Current Limitations

### Current Architecture Problems
- **Polling Overhead**: Frontend polls backend every 1 second regardless of file changes
- **Poor User Experience**: 1-second delay for detecting file modifications
- **Resource Waste**: Constant HTTP requests create unnecessary network/CPU load
- **Scalability Issues**: Poor performance with multiple concurrent users
- **Inefficient**: No adaptation to actual file system activity patterns

### Current System Components
- **Frontend**: React app with `fileWatcher.ts` polling service
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API from `server/sample-tasks/`
- **Storage**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Fallback**: localStorage caching for offline scenarios

---

## 2. Recommended Solution: Push-Based Architecture

### Architecture Overview
**Backend chokidar + SSE Frontend** represents the optimal approach:

#### Key Technical Components
1. **chokidar** on backend for efficient file system monitoring
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time client communication
3. **Event-driven architecture** replacing constant polling
4. **Graceful degradation** with polling fallback mechanism

#### Solution Benefits
- **Immediate Updates**: <100ms detection vs current 1000ms delay
- **Resource Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in network requests and CPU usage
- **Better Scalability**: Supports 50+ concurrent users
- **Enhanced UX**: Real-time collaborative editing experience
- **Professional Standards**: Aligns with modern web architecture patterns

## 4. Expected Performance Benefits and Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Update Latency**: <100ms (current: 1000ms) - **90% improvement**
- **Network Requests**: 50%+ reduction (from 60+/minute to variable)
- **CPU Usage**: 50%+ reduction compared to constant polling
- **Memory Impact**: <20% increase for SSE connections vs polling overhead
- **Scalability**: Support 50+ concurrent SSE connections

### Quality of Life Improvements
- **Battery Life**: Reduced client-side polling extends mobile battery
- **Responsiveness**: Immediate visual feedback for file changes
- **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing capabilities
- **Professional Experience**: Enterprise-grade real-time updates

## 5. Configuration Approach and Terminology

### Issue Management System
After extensive discussion, the project adopted a sophisticated issue management approach:

#### Issue Code Convention: **MDT-###**
- **M**DT = Markdown Ticket project code
- **###** = Sequential numbering (001, 002, 003, ...)
- **Phase tracking**: Informational in Phase/Epic field (not part of ID)
- **Example**: MDT-001, MDT-002, MDT-003

#### Document Structure
```yaml
- **Code**: MDT-001
- **Title/Summary**: Push-Based File Watching Architecture
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Date Created**: 2025-08-31
- **Type**: Architecture
- **Priority**: High
- **Phase/Epic**: Phase A (Foundation)
```

#### Terminology Decision
- **User-facing**: "Issues" (familiar, Jira-aligned terminology)
- **Technical Reality**: Formal Change Requests with ADR lifecycle
- **Dual Nature**: Active development issues → Permanent architectural decisions

#### Configuration System
Project-specific configuration via `.cr-config.toml`:
```toml
[project]
name = "Markdown Ticket Board"
code = "MDT"

[issues] 
prefix = "MDT"
startNumber = 1

[paths]
issueDirectory = "CRs"
templateSource = "~/.config/dev-docs/templates/CRs_manual.md"
```

## 6. Testing Strategy and Risk Assessment

### Comprehensive Testing Approach

#### Unit Tests
- File watcher event detection accuracy
- SSE event formatting and broadcasting  
- Frontend event handling and state updates
- Fallback mechanism activation

#### Integration Tests
- Full file-change-to-UI-update flow
- Multiple client synchronization scenarios
- Network failure and reconnection handling
- Performance benchmarks vs current polling

#### Load Tests
- 50+ concurrent SSE connections
- High-frequency file change scenarios
- Memory and CPU usage under load
- Connection stability over extended periods

### Risk Assessment with Mitigations

#### High Risk Items
1. **SSE Connection Stability**
   - **Risk**: Network interruptions cause dropped connections
   - **Mitigation**: Robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to existing polling system

2. **File System Event Reliability**  
   - **Risk**: Cross-platform file watching inconsistencies
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive chokidar configuration testing
   - **Validation**: File event accuracy across different operating systems

#### Medium Risk Items
1. **Multi-Client Race Conditions**
   - **Risk**: Concurrent edits create conflicts
   - **Mitigation**: Event ordering and conflict detection mechanisms
   - **Strategy**: Last-writer-wins with user notification

2. **Memory Leaks**
   - **Risk**: Long-running SSE connections accumulate memory
   - **Mitigation**: Proper cleanup and connection management
   - **Monitoring**: Memory usage tracking during development

#### Low Risk Items
1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Status**: Existing API endpoints remain unchanged
   - **Impact**: Zero breaking changes for current functionality

2. **Performance Regression**
   - **Status**: Extensive benchmarking planned
   - **Rollout**: Gradual implementation with feature flags

     private eventQueue: FileChangeEvent[] = [];
     private clients: Set<Response> = new Set();
   }
   ```

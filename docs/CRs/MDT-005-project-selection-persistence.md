# Project Selection Persistence

**Note**: This ticket was renumbered from MDT-004 to MDT-005 due to a pre-existing MDT-004 (MCP Server for Universal CR Management) that was created earlier.

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
In Single Project view, the project dropdown does not "remember" the chosen project. Users must re-select their project every time they refresh the page or return to the application.

### Current State
Project selection is lost on page refresh, requiring users to manually select their project each time.

### Desired State
Project selection should be remembered and automatically restored when users return to the application.

### Rationale
Improves user experience by eliminating repetitive project selection tasks.

### Impact Areas
- Frontend project selection logic
- Browser storage integration

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Approaches Considered
- **localStorage**: Persistent across browser sessions, domain-specific
- **sessionStorage**: Only persists for current tab session
- **URL parameters**: Would clutter URLs and break bookmarking

### Chosen Approach
Use localStorage to store selected project ID and restore on application load.

### Rejected Alternatives
- sessionStorage: Too limited (lost on tab close)
- URL parameters: Poor UX and URL clutter

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Technical Requirements
- Store selected project ID in browser localStorage
- Load and restore project selection on application startup
- Handle cases where stored project no longer exists

### UI/UX Changes
No visual changes - behavior enhancement only.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Selected project persists across browser sessions
- [ ] Project selection restored on page reload
- [ ] Graceful handling when saved project no longer exists
- [ ] No impact on performance or user privacy

## 5. Implementation Notes
*To be filled during/after implementation*

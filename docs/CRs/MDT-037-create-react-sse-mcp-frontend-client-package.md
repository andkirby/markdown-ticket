description: Develop a React package (@mcp/react-sse-client) that provides SSE-based communication with MCP servers for frontend log streaming and command handling. The package should enable LLM systems to interact with React applications in real-time through Server-Sent Events, supporting console log interception, context gathering, and bidirectional command execution.
rationale: Current MCP implementations lack standardized frontend integration. This package will provide a clean, reusable solution for React applications to participate in MCP workflows, enabling LLM-driven debugging, monitoring, and interactive development experiences.

# Create React SSE MCP Frontend Client Package

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
Develop a React package that provides SSE-based communication with MCP servers for frontend log streaming and command handling. The package should enable LLM systems to interact with React applications in real-time through Server-Sent Events.

### Current State
- No standardized React integration for MCP servers
- Frontend applications cannot participate in LLM-driven debugging workflows
- Manual implementation required for each project wanting MCP frontend integration
- SSE communication patterns need to be rebuilt for each use case

### Desired State
- NPM package `@mcp/react-sse-client` available for easy installation
- React hook `useMCPClient()` for simple integration
- Automatic console log interception and streaming
- Bidirectional command execution (LLM → Frontend)
- Rich context gathering (DOM state, user interactions, performance metrics)
- TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

### Rationale
Current MCP implementations lack standardized frontend integration. This package will provide a clean, reusable solution for React applications to participate in MCP workflows, enabling LLM-driven debugging, monitoring, and interactive development experiences.

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Technical Approach
- **SSE-based Communication**: Use Server-Sent Events for receiving commands from MCP server
- **HTTP POST for Logs**: Send console logs and context via HTTP POST requests
- **React Hook Pattern**: Provide `useMCPClient(config)` hook for easy integration
- **Console Override**: Non-intrusive console method interception
- **Context Gathering**: Automated collection of DOM state, user interactions, and performance data

### Architecture Components
1. **MCPClient Class**: Core SSE connection and log management
2. **useMCPClient Hook**: React integration layer
3. **ConsoleInterceptor**: Console method override manager
4. **ContextGatherer**: Rich application state collection
5. **CommandExecutor**: Safe execution of LLM-provided debug commands

## 3. Implementation Specification

├── src/
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useMCPClient.ts

```

### Core API Design
```typescript
// Hook Usage
const { status, sessionId, executeCommand } = useMCPClient({
  endpoint: '/mcp-frontend',
  sessionId: 'optional-session-id',
  logBufferSize: 1000,
  contextGathering: {
    performance: true,
    userInteractions: true,
    domState: true
  }
});

// Types
interface MCPConfig {
  endpoint: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  logBufferSize?: number;
  contextGathering?: ContextConfig;
}

interface LogEntry {
  timestamp: number;
  level: 'log' | 'warn' | 'error' | 'info' | 'debug';
  message: string;
  context: ApplicationContext;
  traceId: string;
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Auto-initialization**: Automatically start on hook mount
2. **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup on unmount
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on connection failures
4. **Security**: Sandboxed execution of LLM commands
5. **Performance**: Efficient log buffering and context gathering

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Package installable via `npm install @mcp/react-sse-client`
- [ ] `useMCPClient()` hook integrates with React components without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Console logs (log, warn, error, info, debug) automatically captured and streamed
- [ ] SSE connection established and maintained with auto-reconnection
- [ ] LLM commands received via SSE and executed safely
- [ ] Rich context data collected (URL, DOM state, user interactions, performance)
- [ ] TypeScript definitions included and accurate

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Compatible with React 16.8+ (hooks support)
- [ ] Bundle size < 50KB minified
- [ ] Zero runtime dependencies beyond React
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended sessions
- [ ] SSE connection recovers from network interruptions

### Security Requirements
- [ ] LLM-provided code executed in sandboxed environment
- [ ] Sensitive data (passwords, tokens) filtered from logs
- [ ] CSP-compatible implementation

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive README with examples
- [ ] TypeScript definitions for all public APIs
- [ ] Detailed inline documentation
- [ ] Example React app demonstrating usage

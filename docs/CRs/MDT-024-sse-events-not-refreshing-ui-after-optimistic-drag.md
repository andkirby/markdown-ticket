# State synchronization issues between Board components and useMultiProjectData hook

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
Two critical issues were affecting the Board component functionality:
1. **Drag-and-drop operations**: Tickets would visually snap back to original column after dropping, despite successful backend updates
2. **Project switching**: When switching between projects, tickets would not update to show the new project's tickets

### Current State
Board component architecture had a state synchronization disconnect where:
- SingleProjectView maintained its own ticket state via useState
- Board component received stale prop data instead of fresh hook data  
- useMultiProjectData hook contained the correct, up-to-date state
- This created two separate ticket arrays that weren't synchronized

### Desired State
Unified state management where Board component uses useMultiProjectData hook exclusively for both display and state operations, ensuring immediate UI updates for both drag-and-drop and project switching.

### Rationale
Critical user experience issues where users couldn't see immediate feedback for their actions, making the interface feel unresponsive and unreliable.

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue originated from Board component refactoring that introduced prop-based data passing while maintaining hook-based state management operations. This created a dual state system:

1. **Display State**: Board received ticket data via props from SingleProjectView  
2. **Management State**: Board used useMultiProjectData hook for operations (drag-and-drop, project switching)
3. **The Disconnect**: Operations updated hook state, but UI displayed prop state

### Solution Strategy
Remove redundant prop passing between SingleProjectView and Board components:
- **Before**: `<Board tickets={tickets} selectedProject={selectedProject} loading={loading} />`
- **After**: `<Board showHeader={false} enableProjectSwitching={false} />`
- **Result**: Board uses internal useMultiProjectData hook for both display and state management

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Primary Fix - SingleProjectView.tsx
**Removed redundant props** (lines 180-188):
- `tickets={tickets}` - Let Board manage its own tickets via hook
- `selectedProject={selectedProject}` - Let Board handle project state  
- `loading={loading}` - Let Board manage loading state
- **Kept**: UI control props (`showHeader={false}`, `enableProjectSwitching={false}`, `sortPreferences`)

### Architecture Restoration
- Board component now uses hook data exclusively when in multi-project mode
- SingleProjectView integration maintained through UI control props only
- State synchronization restored through single-source-of-truth architecture

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- [x] Tickets visually move to target column immediately when dropped
- [x] No visual "snap back" to original column after successful drop
- [x] Backend state correctly updated (verified via API calls and file changes)
- [x] Real-time updates continue to work via SSE for cross-client sync

### Project Switching Functionality  
- [x] Tickets update immediately when switching between projects
- [x] Correct project-specific tickets displayed (DEB ↔ MDT ↔ CR-A*** etc.)
- [x] API calls made correctly for new project data
- [x] Loading states handled properly during transitions

### Integration Tests
- [x] Multi-project dashboard Board view works correctly
- [x] SingleProjectView Board mode works correctly  
- [x] Both modes can coexist without interference

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Implementation Process (2025-09-07)
1. **Issue Identification**: User reported drag-and-drop tickets not updating UI immediately
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Comprehensive debugging revealed state synchronization disconnect
3. **Historical Analysis**: Compared with working commit `2c8c094` to identify regression point
4. **Targeted Fix**: Removed redundant prop passing in SingleProjectView
5. **Verification**: Both drag-and-drop and project switching confirmed working

### Debug Process Insights
- **API Verification**: Confirmed backend operations were successful throughout
- **State Flow Tracking**: Logging revealed hook was updating correctly but UI wasn't reflecting changes
- **Component Integration**: Issue was in component boundaries, not core logic
- **Working Reference**: Commit `2c8c094` provided crucial baseline for comparison

### Architecture Improvements
- **Single Source of Truth**: Board component now has unified state management
- **Clean Component Boundaries**: Props used only for UI control, not data passing
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better debugging and error recovery capabilities

## 6. References

### Related Issues
- **MDT-023**: Drag-and-drop tickets not updating UI immediately (predecessor issue)
- **Root Cause**: Similar state synchronization problem affecting different operations
- **Working Baseline**: Commit `2c8c094` provided reference implementation

### Code Changes
- **Modified**: `src/components/SingleProjectView.tsx` (removed redundant props)
- **Enhanced**: `src/components/Board.tsx` (improved dual-mode support)
- **Preserved**: `src/hooks/useMultiProjectData.ts` (core functionality intact)
- **Architecture**: Restored single-source-of-truth state management pattern

# UAT: MDT-248

## Round 1 — 2026-09-23

**Feedback** (user, live use of the split mode):

1. "It sits in a small window" — the split modal kept document-mode whitespace (10dvh top anchor, 2rem card margins) and capped height accordingly, so the working surface felt cramped.
2. "When I scroll, tabs bar is fixed" — the whole ticket column was one scroll container: the title scrolled away, the translucent sticky tabs floated mid-view, and chrome felt unstable.
3. "X button just appears over…" — the card-absolute close × kept its fixed position while content scrolled under it, so it ended up hovering over prose once the header had scrolled away.

**Root cause**: split mode had kept the chrome model of the free-growing document modal (absolute ×, sticky tabs, tall anchor) while switching to internal scrolling — the two were mismatched.

**Fix** (`fix(MDT-248): split mode as pinned-chrome work surface`):

- Split mode is an app panel: ticket-column header + sub-document tabs are pinned; only the content region below the tabs scrolls (`.subdoc-content` is the scroller). The × now always sits over the pinned title bar.
- Frame reclaims height while split: container top anchor 10dvh → 3dvh, card margins `sm:my-8` → 0.5rem, body cap `calc(100dvh - 3dvh - 2.5rem)`.
- Scroll transfer retargeted to the content region and captured at click time (the pane-header focus effect scrolls the overlay before a parent effect could read the offset — found by the strengthened E2E).

**Verification**:

- E2E `side-doc-pane.spec.ts` 9/9 — BR-1.1 now locks the new contract: pre-split offset transfers into the content scroller, and after a deep scroll the title + tabs stay visible with the × above the tabs band.
- `bun run validate:ts`, `bun run build`, `bun run lint:frontend`, TV unit suites — green.

**Status**: round 1 addressed; awaiting next look.

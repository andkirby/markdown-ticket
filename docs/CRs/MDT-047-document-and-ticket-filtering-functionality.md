# Document and Ticket Filtering and Sorting Functionality

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
Users need efficient ways to locate specific documents and tickets, and organize them by various attributes. As projects grow larger with more content, finding relevant items becomes increasingly difficult without proper filtering and sorting capabilities.

### Current State
- Documents View has no search or sorting capabilities
- Board View has sorting functionality for tickets but no filtering
- Users must manually scroll through all items to find what they need
- No way to organize documents by name, date, or other attributes

### Desired State
- Documents View with search filter and sorting capabilities
- Board View with both filtering and sorting for tickets
- Multi-term search support (e.g., "sort ticket" finds items with both terms)
- Intuitive UI controls for both filtering and sorting
- Real-time filtering as user types

### Rationale
Efficient content discovery is essential for productivity. Users need to quickly locate relevant documents and tickets, especially as projects scale. Combined filtering and sorting provides maximum flexibility for content organization.

### Impact Areas
- Documents View UI
- Board View UI
- User Experience
- Performance (for large datasets)

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Filtering Approach
- **Search Input Component**: Reusable FilterControls component with search icon and clear button
- **Multi-term Logic**: Split search query by spaces, require ALL terms to match (AND logic)
- **Search Fields**:
  - Documents: filename and title
  - Tickets: title, code, and description
- **Performance**: Use React useMemo for filtered results to prevent unnecessary re-computation

### Sorting Approach
- **Documents**: Sort by name, title, date modified
- **Tickets**: Leverage existing SortControls component (already implemented)
- **UI Pattern**: Dropdown for sort attribute + direction toggle button

### Architecture Decisions
- Custom components over third-party libraries for simple use cases
- Client-side filtering/sorting for better responsiveness
- Functional components with hooks following React best practices

## 3. Implementation Specification

### FilterControls Component
```typescript
interface FilterControlsProps {
  searchQuery: string;
  onSearchChange: (query: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
}
```

### Documents View Enhancements
- Add search input in Documents sidebar header
- Implement filtering logic that preserves folder structure
- Add sorting dropdown near search input
- Sort options: Name (A-Z/Z-A), Title (A-Z/Z-A), Date Modified (Newest/Oldest)

### Board View Enhancements
- Add FilterControls component next to existing SortControls
- Filter tickets across all columns simultaneously
- Maintain existing sorting functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- Use useMemo for filtered/sorted results
- Debounce search input if needed for large datasets
- Efficient tree traversal for nested document structures

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Documents View
- ✅ Search input filters documents by filename and title
- ✅ Multi-term search works (e.g., "user guide" finds documents with both words)
- ✅ Folder structure preserved during filtering
- ✅ Sorting dropdown with Filename, Title, Created Date, Update Date options
- ✅ Direction toggle for ascending/descending sort
- ✅ Clear button to reset search
- ✅ Real file date sorting using filesystem timestamps
- ✅ Date display in document viewer header

### Board View
- ✅ Filter input appears next to sort controls
- ✅ Filtering works across title, code, and description
- ✅ Multi-term search with AND logic
- ✅ Filtered tickets maintain column organization
- ✅ Real-time filtering as user types
- ✅ Clear button functionality

### Performance
- ✅ Filtering is responsive even with 100+ items
- ✅ No noticeable lag during real-time search
- ✅ Sorting is instantaneous

### UI/UX
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing components
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for active filters/sorts
- ✅ 40% wider dropdown for better usability
- [ ] Accessible keyboard navigation
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Completed Features
- ✅ FilterControls component created with search icon and clear button
- ✅ Document filtering implemented in Documents View
  - ✅ Multi-term search with AND logic
  - ✅ Filters by filename and title
  - ✅ Preserves folder structure during filtering
- ✅ Ticket filtering implemented in Board View
  - ✅ Filters by title, code, and description
  - ✅ Real-time filtering with performance optimization
- ✅ Document sorting functionality
  - ✅ Sort by Filename, Title, Created Date, Update Date
  - ✅ Direction toggle (ascending/descending)
  - ✅ Real file date sorting using filesystem stats
  - ✅ 40% wider dropdown for better usability
- ✅ Enhanced file date display in document viewer
  - ✅ Shows "Created: [date] | Updated: [date]" header
  - ✅ Formatted dates with readable format
- ✅ Backend enhancements
  - ✅ Added fs.stat() calls to read file timestamps
  - ✅ Returns dateCreated and lastModified for all documents

### Technical Considerations
- Filtering logic handles nested folder structures correctly
- Performance optimized with useMemo for large datasets
- Component reusability maintained across different views
- State management follows React functional component patterns

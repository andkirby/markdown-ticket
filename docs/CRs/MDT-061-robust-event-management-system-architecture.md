# Robust Event Management System Architecture

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement

The current event management system has proven fragile and breaks easily during development:

- **Tight Coupling**: Event handling mixed with state management in hooks
- **Stale Closures**: Refs + closures in useEffect causing stale data issues
- **Multiple Event Systems**: 4 different mechanisms (SSE, callbacks, window events, React state) fighting each other
- **Complex Event Flow**: 14+ steps from file change to UI update
- **No Single Source of Truth**: State scattered across React, localStorage, and SSE
- **Difficult to Debug**: No visibility into event flow or history

### Current State

Event handling spread across:
- `realtimeFileWatcher.ts` - SSE connection + event handling + business logic
- `useMultiProjectData.ts` - State management + event subscriptions
- `fileService.ts` - API calls + localStorage + state updates
- Custom window events and callbacks

### Desired State

Centralized, robust event architecture with:
- **EventBus**: Single source of truth for all events
- **SSEClient**: Dedicated SSE connection manager
- **DataLayer**: Clean API abstraction
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Built-in debugging tools**
- **Type-safe event handling**

### Impact Areas

- Frontend event handling
- Real-time updates via SSE
- Component state management
- API communication layer
- Developer debugging experience

## 2. Rationale

### Why This Change Is Needed

1. **Reliability**: Current system breaks frequently during normal development
2. **Maintainability**: Fragile patterns make it hard to add new features
3. **Debuggability**: No way to trace event flow or inspect event history
4. **Developer Experience**: New developers struggle to understand event flow
5. **Future-Proofing**: Foundation for advanced features (offline mode, conflict resolution)

### Benefits

- 90% fewer event-related bugs
- 40% less code (~800 → ~500 lines)
- Faster debugging with event history viewer
- Easier maintenance and onboarding
- Better performance (fewer re-renders)

## 3. Solution Analysis

### Approaches Considered

1. **Fix Current System** - Patch existing issues
   - Pros: Less work upfront
   - Cons: Fundamental architectural issues remain
   
2. **Third-Party Library** (Redux, MobX, Zustand)
   - Pros: Battle-tested, community support
   - Cons: Overkill for this use case, learning curve
   
3. **Custom Event System** - Build lightweight, purpose-built solution ✅ CHOSEN
   - Pros: Exactly what we need, no dependencies, full control
   - Cons: Need to maintain it ourselves

### Chosen Approach

Custom event management system with three core services:

**EventBus** - Central event router
- Type-safe pub/sub pattern
- Event history for debugging
- Proper cleanup with unsubscribe functions
- React hook integration

**SSEClient** - SSE connection manager
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Maps SSE events to business events
- Connection status monitoring
- Emits to EventBus (no business logic)

**DataLayer** - API abstraction
- Centralized API calls
- Response normalization
- Consistent error handling
- Clean interface for components

### Why Not Other Approaches

- **Fix Current**: Band-aid solution, issues will recur
- **Third-Party**: Adds unnecessary complexity and bundle size

## 4. Implementation Specification

### Core Services

#### EventBus (`src/services/eventBus.ts`)
```typescript
// Singleton event bus
class EventBus {
  on<T>(eventType: EventType, handler: EventListener<T>): UnsubscribeFn
  emit<T>(eventType: EventType, payload: T, source: 'sse'|'ui'|'api'): void
  getRecentEvents(count?: number): Event[]
  getStats(): EventBusStats
}

// React hook for components
function useEventBus<T>(eventType: EventType, handler: EventListener<T>): void
```

#### SSEClient (`src/services/sseClient.ts`)
```typescript
class SSEClient {
  connect(url: string): void
  disconnect(): void
  isSSEConnected(): boolean
  getStats(): SSEStats
  private handleSSEMessage(data: SSEMessageData): void
  private scheduleReconnect(): void
}
```

#### DataLayer (`src/services/dataLayer.ts`)
```typescript
const dataLayer = {
  fetchTickets(projectId: string): Promise<Ticket[]>
  createTicket(projectId: string, data: TicketData): Promise<Ticket>
  updateTicket(projectId: string, code: string, updates: Partial<Ticket>): Promise<Ticket>
  deleteTicket(projectId: string, code: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Event Types

```typescript
type EventType =
  | 'ticket:created'
  | 'ticket:updated'
  | 'ticket:deleted'
  | 'project:created'
  | 'project:changed'
  | 'project:deleted'
  | 'sse:connected'
  | 'sse:disconnected'
  | 'sse:error'
  | 'error:api'
  | 'error:network'
  | 'system:refresh'
```

### Event Flow

```
File System Change
    ↓
Backend SSE
    ↓
SSEClient.handleSSEMessage()  ← Translates SSE to business events
    ↓
EventBus.emit('ticket:updated')  ← Central router
    ↓
Component useEventBus hook  ← Subscribe to specific events
    ↓
Update UI
```

### Dev Tools

#### EventHistory Component (`src/components/DevTools/EventHistory.tsx`)
- Visual event history viewer
- Filter and search events
- Listener statistics
- Only renders in development mode

### Migration Strategy

**Non-Breaking Migration**:
1. New system runs alongside old code
2. Add EventHistory debug component
3. Migrate components one by one
4. Remove old code when confident
5. Rollback: Just comment out new, uncomment old

### Documentation

- **Architecture**: `docs/architecture/event-system/event-system-architecture.md`
- **Quick Start**: `docs/architecture/event-system/QUICK_START_NEW_EVENT_SYSTEM.md`
- **Summary**: `docs/architecture/event-system/EVENT_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`

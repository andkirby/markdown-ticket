# Markdown document viewer with tree navigation

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
As a web user, I want to be able to view .md documents within the application so that I don't need an external viewer to read project documentation.

### Current State
- Users must use external tools to view markdown files
- No integrated documentation viewing capability
- Documentation scattered across project directories

### Desired State
- Integrated markdown document viewer within single project view
- Tree navigation showing folder structure up to 3 levels deep
- Collapsible folders for better organization
- Seamless switching between Board and Documents views

### Rationale
Improves user workflow by eliminating the need for external markdown viewers and provides integrated access to project documentation.

### Impact Areas
- User Interface
- File System
- Navigation

## 2. Solution Analysis

### UI Design Decisions
1. **View Toggle**: "Board/Documents" toggle within single project view ‚úÖ
2. **File Display**: Show only .md files in tree navigation ‚úÖ
3. **Root Detection**: Start from project's configured path (from project.toml) ‚úÖ
4. **Navigation Component**: Use `react-arborist` or `@mui/x-tree-view` ‚úÖ
5. **Content Display**: Render markdown using existing showdown converter ‚úÖ

### Technical Considerations
1. **File Discovery**: Scan up to 3 levels from project's configured path
2. **Project Path**: Use `path` field from `~/.config/markdown-ticket/projects/[project].toml`
3. **Exclusions**: Read `.mdt-config.toml` from project path for exclusion rules
4. **Markdown Rendering**: Use existing showdown converter (same as tickets)
5. **File Filtering**: Only display .md files in tree navigation

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Frontend Components
```
DocumentsView/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DocumentsLayout.tsx      # Main layout with sidebar + content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FileTree.tsx            # Tree navigation component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MarkdownViewer.tsx      # Markdown content renderer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PathSelector.tsx        # Phase 1.2: Path selection interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewToggle.tsx          # Board/Documents toggle
```

### Phase 1.2: Path Selection Interface (‚úÖ Completed)
**Components Added:**
- `PathSelector.tsx` - Checkbox-based file/folder selection interface
- Enhanced `DocumentsLayout.tsx` - Detects unconfigured projects and shows PathSelector

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /api/filesystem` - Browse file system with tree structure
- `POST /api/documents/configure` - Save selected paths to project configuration
- Enhanced `GET /api/documents` - Returns 404 for unconfigured projects

**Workflow:**
1. When opening Documents view, check if `document_paths` exists in `.mdt-config.toml`
2. If not configured, show PathSelector with checkbox tree of project files
3. User selects desired files/folders and clicks "Save Selection"
4. Configuration is saved to `.mdt-config.toml` and Documents view reloads

### File Discovery Logic
- Read `document_paths` from `.mdt-config.toml` in project root
- Support both single files (e.g., "README.md") and directories (e.g., "docs")
- For directories: scan up to max_depth levels for .md files
- For single files: include if they end with .md
- Exclude directories listed in exclude_folders during directory scanning

### Configuration Integration
```toml
# .mdt-config.toml
[project]
name = "Markdown Ticket Board"
code = "MDT"
path = "docs/CRs"
# ... other project settings

# Documents configuration (under [project] section)
document_paths = [
    "README.md",           # Single file from root
    "docs",               # Directory (will scan for .md files)
    "CHANGELOG.md"        # Another single file
]
exclude_folders = [
    "docs/CRs",           # Exclude tickets folder
    "node_modules",
    ".git"
]
max_depth = 3
```

### Navigation Tree Structure (Only .md files)
```
üìÅ Project Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ TOML Configuration Specification for Ticket Board
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   CONFIG_SPECIFICATION.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ Project-Specific AI Instructions Template

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ MD Ticket Board

```
*Note: Shows H1 titles as primary labels with filenames as footnotes*

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Implementation Update (2025-09-06)
**‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Phase 1 MVP with additional enhancements

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Configuration-based Discovery**: Uses `document_paths` in `.mdt-config.toml` under `[project]` section
2. **H1 Title Extraction**: Reads first `# Title` from each markdown file for display labels
3. **Filename Footnotes**: Shows actual filename in smaller text below H1 title
4. **Directory Structure**: Preserves folder hierarchy (e.g., docs/ folder with children)
5. **Mixed Path Support**: Handles both individual files and directories in same config
6. **Proper Exclusions**: Respects `exclude_folders` during directory scanning

**Configuration Method**:
- Projects declare document paths in `.mdt-config.toml` under `[project]` section
- Support both single files (`README.md`) and directories (`docs/`)
- Only scan configured paths, not entire project directory
- Maintains exclude_folders for directory scanning

**Benefits**:
- Explicit control over what documents are shown
- Better performance (only scan configured paths)
- Support for individual files from any location
- User-friendly labels with H1 titles
- Maintains security through path configuration

### Phase 1.5 Enhancement (2025-09-30)
**‚úÖ Collapsible Folders**: Added expand/collapse functionality to folder navigation with chevron icons. All folders start expanded by default. (`src/components/DocumentsView/FileTree.tsx`)

### Original Decisions (2025-09-06)
1. **UI**: Board/Documents toggle within single project view
2. **File Display**: Only .md files shown in tree navigation
3. **Root Detection**: Start from directory containing .mdt-config.toml
4. **Navigation**: Use react-arborist or @mui/x-tree-view
5. **Rendering**: Use existing showdown converter (same as tickets)

### Questions for Consideration

### UI/UX Questions
1. **File Types**: Show only .md files in tree, or show all files but only allow viewing .md?
2. **Default View**: Should Documents view remember last opened file?
3. **Search**: Should we add search functionality for documents?

### Technical Questions
1. **Caching**: Should we cache file tree structure for performance?
2. **Real-time Updates**: Should tree update when files are added/removed?
3. **Large Files**: How to handle very large markdown files?

### Configuration Questions
1. **Custom Exclusions**: Allow per-project exclusion patterns?
2. **Depth Limit**: Make max depth configurable per project?
3. **File Extensions**: Support other text formats (.txt, .rst)?

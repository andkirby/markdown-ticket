title: Migrate server codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript
status: Proposed
dateCreated: 2025-10-18T00:00:00.000Z
type: Architecture
priority: High
phaseEpic: Technical Infrastructure
description: The server directory contains 39 JavaScript files that need to be converted to TypeScript to improve type safety, developer experience, and maintainability. This migration will leverage existing TypeScript infrastructure and shared types while addressing specific challenges around file system operations, YAML parsing, and dynamic object manipulation.
rationale: Converting to TypeScript will provide compile-time error detection, better IDE support, improved code documentation through types, and reduced runtime errors. The existing frontend and shared code already use TypeScript, making this a natural evolution to unify the entire codebase under a single type system.

# Migrate server codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
The server directory contains 39 JavaScript files that lack type safety, making the codebase prone to runtime errors, difficult to refactor, and challenging for new developers to understand. While the frontend and shared modules already benefit from TypeScript's type system, the server remains in JavaScript, creating an inconsistency in the development experience.

### Current State
- 39 JavaScript files in the server directory using ES modules
- No compile-time type checking for server code
- Runtime errors that could be caught during development
- Inconsistent developer experience between frontend and backend
- Manual type documentation through JSDoc comments (if present)
- Dynamic object manipulation without type constraints
- File system operations without proper typing
- YAML frontmatter parsing with implicit any types

### Desired State
- All server files converted to TypeScript with comprehensive type coverage
- Compile-time error detection and improved IDE support
- Consistent type system across frontend, backend, and shared modules
- Better code documentation through self-documenting types
- Improved refactoring capabilities and reduced runtime errors
- Proper typing for file system operations and YAML parsing
- Enhanced developer onboarding experience

### Rationale
TypeScript migration is critical for maintaining code quality as the system grows. The existing frontend and shared code already demonstrate the benefits of TypeScript, and extending this to the server will create a more robust, maintainable codebase. This migration will reduce bugs, improve developer productivity, and make the codebase more approachable for new team members.

### Impact Areas
- Backend Architecture (controllers, services, repositories, routes, middleware)
- File System Operations (CR file handling, YAML parsing)
- API Endpoint Type Safety
- Development Experience and Tooling
- Error Handling and Validation
- Build System and Deployment

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Approaches Considered

**Option A: Big Bang Migration**
- Convert all 39 files simultaneously
- Pros: Consistent type system immediately, no mixed language period
- Cons: High risk, large merge conflict potential, difficult to test incrementally

**Option B: Incremental Migration by Layer**
- Convert files layer by layer (models → services → controllers → routes)
- Pros: Manageable chunks, can test each layer, lower risk
- Cons: Temporary type boundary complexities, longer migration period

**Option C: Incremental Migration by Module**
- Convert complete functional modules (e.g., all project-related files)
- Pros: Logical grouping, can test complete functionality, clear progress
- Cons: May require type boundaries between converted and unconverted modules

### Chosen Approach: Incremental Migration by Module

This approach provides the best balance of risk management and logical progression. We'll migrate complete functional modules to maintain system integrity while allowing for thorough testing at each stage.

### Migration Strategy

1. **Infrastructure Setup First** - Configure TypeScript for server
2. **Type System Foundation** - Extend shared types for server-specific needs
3. **Module-by-Module Conversion** - Convert complete functional modules
4. **Type Boundary Management** - Handle interactions between converted/unconverted code
5. **Testing and Validation** - Comprehensive testing at each migration step

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

**File System Operations**
- Challenge: Node.js fs module types can be complex
- Solution: Use @types/node and create custom types for file operations

**YAML Frontmatter Parsing**
- Challenge: Dynamic YAML content with varying structures
- Solution: Create generic but constrained types for YAML frontmatter

**Express.js Integration**
- Challenge: Request/response typing for middleware and routes
- Solution: Use existing Express.js types and extend for custom needs

**Dynamic Object Manipulation**
- Challenge: Runtime object property access
- Solution: Use type guards and discriminated unions where possible

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

**TypeScript Configuration**
- Create `server/tsconfig.json` extending root configuration
- Configure build process with appropriate output directory
- Update package.json scripts for TypeScript compilation
- Set up nodemon for TypeScript development

**Development Environment**
- Install necessary type definitions (@types/node, @types/express)
- Configure ESLint for TypeScript in server directory
- Update VSCode workspace settings for optimal TypeScript support
- Create TypeScript build and watch scripts

**Type System Extensions**
- Extend shared CR types for server-specific needs
- Create types for Express request/response objects
- Define types for file system operations and YAML parsing
- Create utility types for common server operations

### Phase 2: Core Types and Utilities

**File System Types**
```typescript
// Types for file operations
interface FileOperationResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: any;
  error?: Error;
}

interface CRFile {
  path: string;
  filename: string;
  content: string;
  frontmatter: CRFrontmatter;
  lastModified: Date;
}
```

**API Types**
```typescript
// Express request/response extensions
interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {
  user?: User;
  project?: Project;
}

interface APIResponse<T = any> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: APIError;
}
```

**YAML Parsing Types**
```typescript
// Frontmatter parsing types
interface CRFrontmatter {
  code: string;
  title: string;
  status: CRStatus;
  type: CRType;
  priority: CRPriority;
  [key: string]: any; // Allow additional properties
}
```

### Phase 3: Module Migration

**Migration Order by Module**
1. **Utils Layer** (ticketNumbering.js, duplicateDetection.js, fsIgnoreList.js)
2. **Middleware Layer** (security.js, errorHandler.js, validation.js)
3. **Repository Layer** (ConfigRepository.js)
4. **Service Layer** (TicketService.js, ProjectService.js, DocumentService.js, etc.)
5. **Controller Layer** (TicketController.js, ProjectController.js, DocumentController.js)
6. **Route Layer** (tickets.js, projects.js, documents.js, etc.)
7. **Main Server** (server.js)

**Each Module Migration Includes**
- Convert .js to .ts with proper types
- Add comprehensive type annotations
- Implement error handling with typed errors
- Add unit tests for type safety
- Update imports/references from dependent modules

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

**Type Boundary Resolution**
- Ensure all module interactions are properly typed
- Resolve any remaining `any` types
- Implement comprehensive error type handling
- Validate API response types

**Build System Integration**
- Update deployment scripts for TypeScript compilation
- Configure production builds with appropriate optimization
- Set up source maps for debugging
- Test the complete build and deployment pipeline

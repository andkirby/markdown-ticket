# Implement PATCH endpoint optimization for drag-and-drop efficiency

## Problem Statement

Drag-and-drop operations for ticket status changes were inefficient, sending full markdown content (~92+ bytes) via PUT requests for simple status updates. This created unnecessary network overhead and potential performance issues as the application scales.

## Current State

- All ticket updates used PUT requests with complete markdown content
- Drag-and-drop status changes transmitted entire ticket data
- Network traffic was ~92+ bytes per status change operation
- No differentiation between full updates and partial status changes

## Desired State

- Implement PATCH endpoint for partial ticket updates
- Optimize drag-and-drop operations to send only changed fields
- Reduce network traffic by ~73% for status-only updates
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PUT operations
- Auto-generate implementation metadata when tickets move to "Implemented" status

## Rationale

- **Network efficiency**: Reduce bandwidth usage for frequent drag-and-drop operations
- **Performance optimization**: Faster response times for status updates
- **Scalability**: Better performance as ticket count and user base grows
- **User experience**: More responsive drag-and-drop interactions
- **Resource optimization**: Reduced server processing for simple status changes

## Impact Areas

- **Backend API**: New PATCH endpoint implementation
- **Frontend Hooks**: Smart request type selection logic
- **UI Components**: Optimized drag-and-drop data transmission
- **Network Traffic**: ~73% reduction for status-only updates
- **User Experience**: Improved responsiveness

## Solution Analysis

**Approaches Considered:**
1. **PATCH with field detection** (Selected)
   - Pros: Minimal network traffic, intelligent request routing, maintains compatibility
   - Cons: Additional complexity in determining update type
2. **Separate status endpoint**
   - Pros: Very specific, minimal overhead
   - Cons: API proliferation, harder to maintain
3. **WebSocket for real-time updates**
   - Pros: Real-time sync
   - Cons: Over-engineering for current needs, complexity

**Trade-offs:**
- Added complexity in frontend logic vs. significant network efficiency gains
- Backward compatibility maintained while optimizing new operations

**Decision:**
Implement PATCH endpoint with intelligent request type detection in frontend hooks.

## Implementation Specification

### Backend Changes
- **New Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/projects/:projectId/crs/:crId`
  - Accepts partial ticket data updates
  - Auto-generates `implementationDate` and `implementationNotes` for "Implemented" status
  - Maintains existing file structure and frontmatter format

### Frontend Changes
- **useMultiProjectData Hook**: 
  - Smart detection of update type (full vs. partial)
  - Route to PATCH for status-only changes, PUT for full updates
- **Board.tsx Component**:
  - Send only `status` field for drag-and-drop operations
  - Maintain existing drag-and-drop UI behavior

### API Specifications
- **PATCH Request**: `{ status: "In Progress" }` (~25 bytes)
- **PUT Request**: Full markdown content (~92+ bytes)
- **Response**: Updated ticket data in both cases

### Configuration Changes
No configuration changes required - backward compatible implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] PATCH endpoint accepts partial ticket updates
- [x] Status-only updates use PATCH requests (~25 bytes)
- [x] Full ticket updates continue using PUT requests
- [x] Backend auto-generates implementation fields for "Implemented" status
- [x] Drag-and-drop operations show ~73% network traffic reduction
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact
- [x] API maintains RESTful conventions
- [x] Error handling works for both PATCH and PUT operations
- [x] File synchronization works correctly with partial updates

## Implementation Notes

**Completed on 2025-09-05:**

✅ **Backend Implementation:**
- Added PATCH `/api/projects/:projectId/crs/:crId` endpoint in `server/server.js`
- Implemented partial update logic with frontmatter merging
- Added auto-generation of `implementationDate` and `implementationNotes` for "Implemented" status

✅ **Frontend Integration:**
- Updated `useMultiProjectData` hook with intelligent PATCH vs PUT selection
- Modified `Board.tsx` to send minimal status data for drag-and-drop operations
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing update flows

✅ **Performance Optimization:**
- Achieved ~73% network traffic reduction for status updates
- Network payload reduced from ~92+ bytes to ~25 bytes for drag-and-drop
- Maintained responsive user experience with optimized data transmission

✅ **Testing & Validation:**
- Verified drag-and-drop operations use PATCH requests
- Confirmed full edit operations continue using PUT requests
- Validated auto-generation of implementation metadata
- Ensured file synchronization works correctly

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- PATCH endpoint merges partial data with existing frontmatter
- Frontend hook detects update scope and routes appropriately
- Backward compatibility maintained for all existing operations
- RESTful API conventions followed throughout

**Files Modified:**
- `server/server.js` - Added PATCH endpoint (lines 684-806)
- `src/hooks/useMultiProjectData.ts` - Added intelligent request routing
- `src/components/Board.tsx` - Simplified drag-and-drop payload

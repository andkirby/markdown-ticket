# Fix frontend compilation errors after attribute simplification

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
Frontend has compilation errors due to references to removed attributes after MDT-029 attribute simplification.

### Current State
- MCP server and documentation updated to simplified attributes
- Frontend still references removed attributes: `source`, `impact`, `effort`, `supersedes`, `relatedDocuments`
- Web UI won't compile or run

### Desired State
- Frontend compiles successfully
- Web UI works with simplified attribute set
- No references to removed attributes

### Rationale
Web UI is broken and unusable after attribute simplification changes

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Root Cause Analysis
MDT-029 removed attributes from schemas but frontend code still references them

### Files Affected
- `src/services/fileService.ts` - Reads/writes removed attributes
- `src/services/markdownParser.ts` - Parses removed attributes
- `src/types/index.ts` - Exports removed enum types
- Various components expecting removed fields

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Technical Requirements
- Remove all references to: `source`, `impact`, `effort`, `supersedes`, `relatedDocuments`
- Update fileService to only handle core attributes
- Update markdownParser to skip removed attributes
- Fix component compilation errors

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Frontend compiles without errors
- [ ] Web UI loads and functions
- [ ] No references to removed attributes
- [ ] Core functionality preserved

## 5. Implementation Notes
*To be filled during implementation*

## 6. References
- Related to: MDT-029 (attribute simplification)

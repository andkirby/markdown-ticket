# Drag-and-drop UI State Synchronization Bug

## 1. Description

### Problem Statement
When users drag a ticket from one column to another in the frontend dashboard, the backend successfully updates the ticket status, but the frontend UI does not reflect the change. The ticket visually remains in the original column until the page is refreshed.

### Current Behavior
1. User drags ticket from "In Progress" to "Done" column
2. Backend API call succeeds and updates ticket status in markdown file
3. Ticket visually snaps back to original column in frontend
4. Page refresh shows ticket correctly positioned in "Done" column

### Expected Behavior
1. User drags ticket from "In Progress" to "Done" column
2. Backend API call succeeds and updates ticket status
3. Frontend UI immediately reflects the change - ticket stays in "Done" column
4. No page refresh required to see correct state

### Root Cause Analysis
The drag-and-drop implementation appears to be missing proper state synchronization between the API response and the frontend state management. Likely causes:
- Frontend state not updated after successful API call
- Optimistic UI update being reverted on drag completion
- Race condition between drag event handlers and API response
- Missing state update in fileService or component state management

### Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: High - Confusing UX, users think operation failed
- **System Stability**: Not affected - backend works correctly
- **Data Integrity**: Safe - data is correctly saved, only UI display issue

## 2. Solution Analysis

### Approaches Considered

**Fix Frontend State Update**:
- Identify where drag completion should update local state
- Ensure API response triggers immediate UI refresh
- Most direct fix for the root cause

**Improve Optimistic Updates**:
- Implement proper optimistic UI updates during drag
- Revert only on API failure, not on success
- Better user experience during network delays

**Enhanced Error Handling**:
- Add visual feedback for successful/failed operations
- Show loading states during API calls
- Clear indication of operation status

### Decision Factors
- **Simplicity**: Direct state update fix is most straightforward
- **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback is critical
- **Maintainability**: Should integrate with existing fileService pattern
- **Risk**: Low risk fix, only affects UI behavior

### Chosen Approach
Fix the frontend state synchronization by ensuring successful API responses properly update the local component state and trigger re-rendering.

### Rejected Alternatives
- **Backend changes**: Not needed, backend works correctly
- **Complete rewrite**: Overkill for isolated UI sync issue
- **Polling refresh**: Would work but creates unnecessary requests

## 3. Implementation Specification

### Technical Requirements
- Identify the drag-and-drop event handler in Column.tsx or related component
- Locate the API call for status updates (likely in fileService.ts)
- Ensure successful API response updates local state immediately
- Verify state change triggers component re-render

### UI/UX Changes
- No visual changes needed
- Existing drag-and-drop interface should work correctly
- May add subtle success animation or feedback if beneficial

### API Changes
No API changes required - backend functionality is working correctly.

### Configuration
No configuration changes needed.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Bug is reproducible in test environment
- [ ] Root cause is identified and documented
- [ ] Fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- [ ] Regression tests added to prevent recurrence
- [ ] No new bugs introduced by the fix

### Bug-Specific Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dragging ticket to new column immediately shows ticket in target column
- [ ] No page refresh required to see updated ticket position
- [ ] Backend status update still occurs correctly (verify in files)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works consistently across all column combinations
- [ ] Multiple rapid drag operations work without state corruption
- [ ] Error handling preserves correct state when API calls fail

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Manual testing of drag-and-drop across all column combinations
- [ ] Automated E2E test for drag-and-drop with immediate UI validation
- [ ] Network failure simulation to ensure proper error handling
- [ ] Multiple concurrent drag operations testing

# Add Automatic Git Worktree Exclusion for Project Discovery

## 1. Description
The project discovery system currently includes git worktree instances in the project selector, creating duplicate entries and cluttering the user interface. Git worktrees are linked working directories that share the same git history as a main repository, typically used for parallel development on different branches.

When developers create git worktrees, these appear as separate directories but represent the same underlying project. This results in:
- Multiple project entries for the same repository
- Confusing project selector UI
- Redundant file watching and resource usage
- User confusion about which "project" to select

**Additional Consideration: Projects Without Configuration Files**

The current discovery logic only considers directories containing `.mdt-config.toml` files as valid projects. However, this excludes legitimate projects that may not have configuration files yet. The worktree detection logic should also handle:

- Directories without `.mdt-config.toml` files that could still be valid projects
- Worktrees of projects that have configuration files in the main repository but not in the worktree
- Legacy projects or newly created workspaces that haven't been configured yet

The detection logic should apply worktree exclusion to all directories being scanned, regardless of whether they contain configuration files, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the filesystem tree.
## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETED
### Core Detection Logic

Implement a multi-layered detection approach:

1. **Fast Path (Pattern-based)**:
   - Analyze directory names against worktree patterns
   - Check for corresponding main project directories
   - No git commands required - immediate results

2. **Verification Path (Git-based)**:
   - Use `git rev-parse --git-dir` to confirm worktree status
   - Check for absolute paths containing `worktrees/`
   - Execute asynchronously to avoid blocking

3. **Caching Layer**:
   - Pre-build worktree cache using `git worktree list`
   - Use `Set` data structure for O(1) lookups
   - Update cache asynchronously during startup

### Integration Points

**Project Scanner Enhancement**:
```typescript
// In scanDirectoryForProjects method
if (this.isGitWorktree(dirPath)) {
    console.log(`Skipping git worktree: ${dirPath}`);
    return; // Skip this directory
}
```

**Non-blocking Initialization**:
```typescript
// Use setImmediate to avoid blocking startup
setImmediate(() => {
    // Build worktree cache asynchronously
    this.buildWorktreeCache();
});
```

### Error Handling

- Add timeouts (2 seconds) to all git commands
- Suppress stderr output to prevent console spam
- Gracefully handle non-git directories and permission errors
- Use pattern-based detection as fallback when git commands fail

### Comprehensive Directory Scanning

**Apply Worktree Detection to All Directories**:

The worktree detection logic should be applied to all directory scanning operations, not just those looking for `.mdt-config.toml` files. This ensures:

```typescript
// In scanDirectoryForProjects method - apply to ALL directories
for (const entry of entries) {
    if (entry.isDirectory() && !entry.name.startsWith('.')) {
        const subDirPath = path.join(dirPath, entry.name);
        
        // Apply worktree exclusion to ALL subdirectories
        if (this.isGitWorktree(subDirPath)) {
            console.log(`Skipping git worktree subdirectory: ${subDirPath}`);
            continue;
        }
        
        // Then continue with normal project detection logic
        // (checking for .mdt-config.toml, etc.)
        this.scanDirectoryForProjects(subDirPath, discovered, maxDepth - 1);
    }
}
```

**Handle Projects Without Configuration Files**:

- The worktree exclusion should run before any configuration file checks
- This prevents scanning worktree directories regardless of their contents
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of the filesystem during project discovery
- Maintains performance by avoiding unnecessary git operations in worktrees
## 2. Rationale

Git worktrees are a common workflow feature where developers need to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts. However, from a project management perspective, these worktrees represent the same logical project and should not appear as separate entities in the project selector.

The current project discovery system scans directories for `.mdt-config.toml` files without considering whether they are part of a git worktree structure. This leads to a poor user experience where the project selector shows:
```
markdown-ticket (main)
markdown-ticket-aws-counter (worktree)
markdown-ticket-smart-link (worktree) 
markdown-ticket-clone (separate repo)
```

Users should only see distinct projects, not worktree variations.

## 3. Solution Analysis

### Worktree Identification Methods

**Method 1: Git Command Detection (Most Accurate)**
- Use `git rev-parse --git-dir` to determine git repository structure
- Worktrees return absolute paths containing `worktrees/` (e.g., `/path/to/main/.git/worktrees/worktree-name`)
- Main repositories return relative paths (e.g., `.git`)
- Use `git worktree list` to pre-cache known worktrees for performance

**Method 2: Filesystem Pattern Detection (Fast Fallback)**
- Analyze directory naming patterns common in worktrees:
  - `project-name-123` (numeric suffixes)
  - `project-name-abc123` (hex commit hash suffixes)
  - `project-name-feature/bug/fix` (branch-type prefixes)
  - `project-name-main/master/develop` (common branch names)
- Check for existence of corresponding "main" project directory
- Provides fast detection without git command overhead

### Performance Considerations

Git commands can be slow and may block application startup if not handled properly. The solution should:
- Use pattern-based detection as the primary fast path
- Employ asynchronous git command verification for accuracy
- Implement caching of known worktrees to avoid repeated checks
- Add timeouts and error suppression to prevent hanging
- Use non-blocking initialization to avoid startup delays

### Implementation Locations

The worktree detection logic should be integrated into:

**Shared Project Service** (`shared/services/ProjectService.ts`)
- Add worktree identification methods to the existing project discovery service
- Modify `scanDirectoryForProjects()` to skip worktree directories
- Implement caching and asynchronous verification

**Server Project Discovery** (`server/projectDiscovery.js`) 
- Leverage the shared service implementation (already uses shared ProjectService)
- No additional changes needed if shared service is properly implemented

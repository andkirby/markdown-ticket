# Markdown Ticket Board

**Organize project tickets as markdown files with AI-powered workflow**

Transform scattered documentation into an organized, version-controlled project management system. <br>

Discuss features with LLM → LLM creates structured tickets → Review → LLM implements code → You review and organize.

## ⚡ Quick Start
### Start the application
#### Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andkirby/markdown-ticket.git
cd markdown-ticket
bin/dc up -d

claude mcp add --scope user --transport http mdt-all http://localhost:3012/mcp
```

Or use MCP connection with STDIO transport:
```bash
claude mcp remove mdt-all --scope user # delete existing MCP 
claude mcp add --scope user mdt-all docker -- exec --env MCP_HTTP_ENABLED=false -i mdt-mcp node /app/mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

#### Local Setup
```bash
# Build JavaScript code
npm run build:all

# Production (built JavaScript files)
./start.sh              # Start fronend/backend production servers

# Add MCP into Claude Code, transport: STDIO 
claude mcp add mdt-all node $PWD/mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

## **Access Points:**
- **Web Interface**: Docker http://localhost:5174 | Local http://localhost:4173 (production) | http://localhost:5173 (development)
- **MCP Endpoint**: Docker http://localhost:3012/mcp | Local `mcp-server/dist/index.js`

🚨 **Note**: MCP integration is required for the full AI-driven workflow. Without it, you only have a basic ticket viewer.

## 🎯 What It Does

**Solves three fundamental problems with AI-driven development:**

### 1. **Markdown Management**
Anyone can create markdown files, but managing them at scale becomes challenging. Files get scattered, navigation breaks down, and tracking progress requires manual hunting through directories.

### 2. **AI Context Persistence**
LLMs have limited context windows and forget previous conversations. This system keeps everything organized and accessible across AI sessions, so no decisions get lost.

### 3. **Specification-Driven Workflow**
Create detailed specifications first, then let AI implement exactly what was specified. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures requirements are actually met.

**The result:** Your scattered markdown files become an organized, version-controlled knowledge base that both AI and humans can work with effectively.

### Planning & Organization

### The Workflow Explained

**Phase 1: Planning** - Discuss requirements with AI assistants using **crafted prompts** for best results. AI creates structured tickets with all necessary sections:
- Description, Rationale, Solution Analysis
- Implementation Specification and Acceptance Criteria

💡 **Pro Tip**: Use the provided prompt template at `prompts/mdt-ticket-creation.md` for consistent, high-quality tickets that AI can implement effectively. Please provide feedback on its effectiveness; it would be greatly appreciated.

**Phase 2: Organization** - Navigate tickets and documents through a beautiful interface with proper formatting, code highlighting, and Mermaid diagrams. Drag and drop tickets between columns to update status.

**Phase 3: Implementation** - When a ticket is ready, give it to AI. AI reads the complete specification and implements exactly what was specified - writes code, tests, and documentation.

**Phase 4: Review** - Review the implementation against requirements, run automated tests, and merge the completed work with confidence.

**Every step is tracked in Git, creating a complete history from discussion to deployment.**

git commit -m "Add user authentication ticket (PROJ-001)"
git push
```

### Team Collaboration
- **No merge conflicts** on project management data
- **Pull requests** include both code and ticket changes
- **Code reviews** show requirement context alongside implementation
- **Complete history** for all decisions and changes

## 🎯 Who This Is For

### ✅ Perfect For
- **Solo developers working with AI assistance** who need to keep track of decisions and progress
- **Engineers who maintain architectural documents** and feature specifications
- **Anyone frustrated with AI context limits** and losing track of important decisions
- **Developers managing feature requests** and change requests for existing projects
- **Projects that require structured documentation** and specification-driven workflow

**This tool shines when AI and humans collaborate on software development through structured tickets and specifications.**

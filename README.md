## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Start the development server** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**:
   - Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
   - Use the "Add New Project" button to create your first project
   - Switch between Board, List, and Documents views using the icon switcher

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup
1. Create your first project using the "Add New Project" button in the UI
2. The system will create both global registry and local project configuration files
3. Start creating tickets using the UI or by following the guide in `docs/create_ticket.md`

### Creating Tickets
- **UI Method**: Use the "Create" button in the application interface
- **Manual Method**: Create markdown files directly in your project's ticket directory
- **Detailed Instructions**: See `docs/create_ticket.md` for comprehensive ticket creation guidelines
- Files follow the naming pattern: `PROJECT-###-title.md`

### Ticket Format
```yaml
---
code: MDT-001
title: Example Ticket
status: Proposed
type: Feature Enhancement
priority: Medium
dateCreated: 2025-09-06T10:00:00.000Z
lastModified: 2025-09-06T15:30:00.000Z
phaseEpic: Phase A

# Ticket Content

```

### Ticket Statuses
- **Proposed**: Initial state for new tickets
- **Approved**: Approved for implementation
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Implemented**: Completed and deployed
- **Rejected**: Not approved for implementation

## Sorting Configuration

The application supports customizable sorting with persistent user preferences.

### Default Sort Attributes
- **Key** (desc) - Ticket identifier (e.g., MDT-001)
- **Title** (asc) - Ticket title
- **Created Date** (desc) - When the ticket was created
- **Update Date** (desc) - When the ticket was last modified

### Custom Sorting Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.config/markdown-ticket/user.toml`:

```toml
[sorting]
attributes = [
    { name = "code", label = "Key", default_direction = "desc", system = true },
    { name = "title", label = "Title", default_direction = "asc", system = true },
    { name = "dateCreated", label = "Created Date", default_direction = "desc", system = true },
    { name = "lastModified", label = "Update Date", default_direction = "desc", system = true },
    # Add custom attributes
    { name = "priority", label = "Priority", default_direction = "desc", system = false },
    { name = "type", label = "Type", default_direction = "asc", system = false }
]

[sorting.preferences]
selected_attribute = "lastModified"
selected_direction = "desc"
```

### Configuration Options

- **name**: Field name in the ticket data
- **label**: Display name in the sort dropdown
- **default_direction**: Default sort direction (`asc` or `desc`)
- **system**: If `true`, cannot be removed by users

### System Attributes Protection
System attributes (`code`, `title`, `dateCreated`, `lastModified`) cannot be removed from the configuration to ensure core functionality remains intact.

## MCP Integration

The project includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI assistant integration:

```bash
# Start MCP server
cd mcp-server
npm run build
npm start
```

### Adding MCP to AI Assistants

**Pre-conditions:**
- Markdown-ticket project installed in `~/markdown-ticket`
- MCP server built (`npm run build` in mcp-server directory)
- Your project has a project code (e.g., "COD")

**Setup from your project directory:**
```bash
cd /path/to/my-project
```

#### Amazon Q CLI

**Local scope** (project-specific, **ðŸ”´ currently not working - keep for future**):
```bash
q mcp add --name mdt-tickets \
  --command "node" \
  --args $HOME/markdown-ticket/mcp-server/dist/index.js \
  --env MCP_PROJECT_FILTER=COD \
  --env MCP_SCAN_PATHS="$(pwd)" \
  --scope workspace --force
```

**Global scope** (works, access all projects):
```bash
q mcp add --name mdt-all \
  --command "node" \
  --args $HOME/markdown-ticket/mcp-server/dist/index.js \
  --scope global --force
```

#### Claude Code

**Local scope** (recommended, LLM sees only one project):
```bash
claude mcp add mdt-tickets node $HOME/markdown-ticket/mcp-server/dist/index.js \
  --env MCP_PROJECT_FILTER=COD \
  --env MCP_SCAN_PATHS=$(pwd)
```

**Global scope** (access any project from anywhere):
```bash
claude mcp add mdt-all node $HOME/markdown-ticket/mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `MCP_PROJECT_FILTER=COD` - Limits MCP to specific project code
- `MCP_SCAN_PATHS=$(pwd)` - Sets project path for scanning

**Scopes Explained:**
- **Local/Workspace**: MCP only available in current project directory
- **Global**: MCP available from any directory, can access all configured projects

### Available MCP Tools

**ðŸŽ¯ Recent Optimization**: Tools have been consolidated for 40% token reduction:
- `list_projects` - List all discovered projects
- `get_project_info` - Get detailed project information
- `list_crs` - List CRs for a project with filtering
- `get_cr` (Consolidated) - Get CR with flexible modes (full, attributes, metadata)
- `create_cr` (Enhanced) - Create CR with embedded template guidance
- `manage_cr_sections` (Consolidated) - List, get, or update CR sections efficiently
- `update_cr_attrs` - Update CR attributes (excludes status)
- `update_cr_status` - Update CR status
- `delete_cr` - Delete CRs (for implemented bug fixes)
- `suggest_cr_improvements` - Get suggestions for improving CRs

**Token Efficiency**: Section operations are 84-94% more efficient than full document updates

**ðŸ“– Complete Documentation**: See `mcp-server/MCP_TOOLS.md` for detailed API reference including response formats, examples, and error handling.

## Project Management

### Creating Projects
- Use the "Add New Project" button in the UI to create new projects with automatic configuration setup

### Editing Projects
- Click the edit button (pencil icon) next to any project to modify name, description, CRs path, and repository URL

### Project Configuration
Projects use a dual-configuration approach:

**Global Registry** (`~/.config/markdown-ticket/projects/{project-dir}.toml`):
```toml
[project]
path = "/path/to/project"
active = true

[metadata]
dateRegistered = "2025-09-07"
lastAccessed = "2025-09-07"
```

**Local Configuration** (`{project}/.mdt-config.toml`):
```toml
[project]
name = "My Project"
code = "MYPROJ"
path = "docs/CRs"
startNumber = 1
counterFile = ".mdt-next"
description = "Project description"
repository = "https://github.com/user/repo"
```

The global registry provides minimal discovery information, while local configuration contains operational details.

## Development

### Quick Start
```bash
npm install                    # Install dependencies
cd server && node server.js   # Start backend (Terminal 1)
npm run dev                    # Start frontend (Terminal 2)
```

### MCP Development Tools
The project includes MCP servers for AI assistant integration:
- **CR Management**: `mcp-server/` - Full CR management via MCP tools
- **Development Logging**: `server/mcp-dev-tools/` - Real-time log access during development

### Complete Development Guide
See **[docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** for:
- Full development environment setup
- MCP server configuration and usage
- Testing procedures and workflows
- Architecture overview and code organization
- Common development tasks and troubleshooting

## File System Integration

- **Automatic Timestamps**: `dateCreated` and `lastModified` are automatically managed from file system timestamps
- **Real-time Updates**: File changes are detected and reflected in the UI immediately
- **Version Control Friendly**: All data stored in markdown files, perfect for Git workflows

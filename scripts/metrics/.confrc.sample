# ============================================================================
# Maintainability Index (MI) Thresholds
# Microsoft standard: MI ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)
# Higher values indicate better maintainability
# ============================================================================
# MI_YELLOW_MAX: Files at or below this value are flagged as yellow
# Microsoft yellow zone: 21-40 (moderate maintainability concerns)
MI_YELLOW_MAX=40

# MI_RED_MAX: Files at or below this value are flagged as red
# Microsoft red zone: 0-20 (significant maintainability issues)
MI_RED_MAX=20

# ============================================================================
# Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) Thresholds
# Measures control flow complexity based on decision points (if, for, etc.)
# Microsoft standard: Simpler code is easier to maintain
# ============================================================================
# CC_YELLOW_MIN: Files at or above this value are flagged as yellow
# Microsoft yellow zone: 11-20 (moderately complex)
CC_YELLOW_MIN=11

# CC_RED_MIN: Files at or above this value are flagged as red
# Microsoft red zone: 21+ (highly complex, needs refactoring)
CC_RED_MIN=21

# ============================================================================
# Cognitive Complexity (CoC) Thresholds
# Measures mental effort to understand code flow (nesting, breaks, etc.)
# Microsoft standard: Lower cognitive load improves readability
# ============================================================================
# COC_YELLOW_MIN: Files at or above this value are flagged as yellow
# Microsoft yellow zone: 11-20 (moderate cognitive effort)
COC_YELLOW_MIN=11

# COC_RED_MIN: Files at or above this value are flagged as red
# Microsoft red zone: 21+ (difficult to understand, simplify logic)
COC_RED_MIN=21

# MD Ticket Board

A modern, responsive Kanban-style ticket board application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This application provides an intuitive interface for managing tickets organized by different statuses (Proposed, In Progress, Implemented, Done).

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Kanban Board Interface**: Drag-and-drop ticket management across columns
- **Markdown-based Tickets**: Tickets stored as individual markdown files
- **Real-time Updates**: File watcher automatically updates the board when tickets change
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Multi-browser Support**: Optimized for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers

### Ticket Management
- **Ticket Creation**: Add new tickets with title, description, priority, and status
- **Ticket Editing**: Inline editing for ticket properties
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tickets between columns with visual feedback
- **Priority System**: Visual priority indicators (High, Medium, Low)
- **Status Tracking**: Track tickets through different workflow stages

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express.js
- **File System**: Direct markdown file manipulation with atomic writes
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks for ticket data management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including unit, component, and E2E tests

## Architecture

### Frontend Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Board.tsx          # Main board container
│   ├── Column.tsx         # Individual status columns
│   ├── Ticket.tsx         # Individual ticket components
│   ├── Button.tsx         # Reusable button component
│   ├── Modal.tsx          # Modal dialogs
│   └── Select.tsx         # Select dropdown component
├── services/
│   ├── fileService.ts     # File system operations
│   ├── fileWatcher.ts     # Directory watching
│   └── useTicketData.ts   # State management hook
├── types/
│   └── ticket.ts          # TypeScript interfaces
└── index.css              # Global styles with Tailwind
```

### Backend Structure
```
server/
├── server.js              # Express server
├── routes/
│   └── tickets.js         # API routes
├── services/
│   └── ticketService.js   # Business logic
└── tasks/                 # Sample ticket data
```

### Data Storage
- **Tickets**: Individual markdown files in `docs/CRs/`
- **File Structure**: Each ticket is a separate `.md` file
- **Metadata**: Frontmatter contains ticket properties (title, priority, status, etc.)
- **Real-time Updates**: File watcher detects changes and updates UI automatically

### Configuration
#### Task File Path Configuration
The application uses a hardcoded path for task files located at `docs/CRs/`. To configure a different path:

1. **Backend Configuration** (`server/server.js`):
   - The `tasksDirectory` variable is set to `path.join(__dirname, 'tasks')`
   - To change the path, modify this line to point to your desired directory
   - Example: `const tasksDirectory = path.join(__dirname, '../my-tasks');`

2. **Frontend Configuration** (`src/services/fileService.ts`):
   - The API base URL is hardcoded to `http://localhost:3001`
   - File operations use the `/api/tickets` endpoint
   - Ensure the backend server is running on the same port

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add `TASKS_DIR=path/to/your/tasks`
   - Note: Currently the application doesn't read from environment variables, so you'll need to modify the code to use them

#### Current Path Structure
```
md-ticket-board/
├── server/
│   └── tasks/           # Default ticket files location
│       ├── CR-A001.md
│       ├── CR-A002.md
│       └── ...
└── src/
    └── services/
        └── fileService.ts  # Handles file operations
```

#### Changing the Task Directory
1. Create your desired task directory structure
2. Update the `tasksDirectory` path in `server/server.js`
3. Ensure the directory exists and is readable/writable
4. Restart the backend server for changes to take effect
